## About

<img src="/assets/img/profilePlaceholder.png" class="img-profile" />

I started my undergrad. studies back on 2016 at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC) and graduated on 2020 by presenting a thesis on Period Change Rates of Classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud with Prof. Marcio Catelan as my advisor. Then, in 2021 I joined UNSW Canberra for a PhD in Physics under the supervision of Dr. Ashley Ruiter, in which I am working with binary systems involving both white dwarf and sub-dwarf B stars.

Additional experience includes a short summer-research at PUC under Prof. Franz Bauer (AGN-related) and a summer internship at ESO Chile under Dr. Claudia Paladini (Interferometry by using the MATISSE instrument). I have participated as a speaker in both ANITA 2022 and 2023, while also being involved in multiple side-projects (check my website for more info.). My academic interests include (but are not limited to) time domain astronomy (pulsating stars, cataclysmic stars, AGNs, etc), multi-messenger astronomy, big data, machine learning and programming. I consider myself both a theoretical and observational astronomer.

## Research interests

- Binary systems (sdB progenitors, Double White Dwarfs)
- Pulsating stars (Cepheids, RR Lyrae, delta Scutis, BLAPs)
- Computational Astrophysics (Stellar structure, Binary population synthesis)
