## About

<img src="/assets/img/priyam.jpg" class="img-profile" />

I have started my PhD studies at UNSW Canberra at ADFA, Australia under the supervision of Dr. Ivo Rolf Seitenzahl and Dr. Ashley Jade Ruiter from 27th April, 2023. I have been awarded the TFS for doing my PhD. Currently we are interested in Integral Field Spectroscopy of Type IA supernova remnnants. I have completed my Master's from Amity University, Kolkata, India (2019-2021) with research in general relativity and Wormholes and my B.Sc in Physics from Durgapur Government College, India (2016-2019). I have also worked as an Assistant Professor in the department of Engineering Physics at Bengal College of Engineering and Technology, India (Oct, 2021-Mar,2023). Apart from my academics, I like to play soccer.

## Research interests

- I am currently working on the type IA Supernova remnant 0509-67.5 in the LMC. My work is to understand the behaviour of reversed shocked ejecta and modelling it to get a better insight of the type IA supernova events. This will also allow us to look into the extreme nucleosynthesis processes comitted in a type IA explosion, thus providing information about the progenitor.
- I also like to work on different fields of general relativity like wormholes and soft condessed matter physics (cosmological toy models in BEC).
